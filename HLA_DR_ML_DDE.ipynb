DDE considers the consecutive pairs (local sequence information) of AA in peptides and generates 400-dimension feature vector. These dipeptides have an associated properties that influence the protein’s function and structure. The working principle of the DDE descriptor relies on three parameters: DPC, theoretical mean (Tm), and theoretical variance (Tv).\n",
